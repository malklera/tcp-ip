# Set up minimal Arch to ease of use

This is not a guide, this is for my future self, or for when I end up nuking the vm and need to install it again.

- Inmediatly after finishing installing Arch and rebooting I have to do this.

`$ curl -o setArch.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malklera/tcp-ip/refs/heads/main/setArch.sh`

Make the file executable

`$ chmod +x setArch.sh`

Run the script

`$ sudo ./setArch.sh`

Once everything finished, reboot
